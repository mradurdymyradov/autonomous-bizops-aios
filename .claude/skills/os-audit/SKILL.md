# OS Audit — is your AIOS still true?

> *Nate Herk's free `/os-audit` skill, unmodified. Source: https://youtu.be/Ek1NBfnnTH0*

Your operating manual, indexes, and wikis are claims about what exists and what's current. This audit checks every claim against reality. Structure problems are loud; freshness problems are silent. When people say "my agent keeps forgetting things," it's usually the agent faithfully reading a frozen index.

**Read-only.** Never fix, move, rename, or delete anything during the audit. The only write is the report file at the end. Fixes happen after the user approves them.

**Works on any Claude Code project.** Look for patterns and intent, not exact paths. The operating manual might be CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or a README with a routing table. An index might be `_index.md`, `INDEX.md`, or a catalog section. A wiki might be one folder or ten. Detect by role, not by name. Never assume a specific person's folder layout.

## Today's context

- Date: use today's real date; all freshness math depends on it
- Scope: the current project root, or the subfolder passed as `$ARGUMENTS`

## The lens: four failure modes, two context types

Every finding this audit produces is a risk of one of the four ways context breaks (field vocabulary via LangChain/Drew Breunig; "bloat" names the cause):

- **Poisoning** — false information sits where the agent reads it, and the model treats everything in context as true. A stale number stated as current, an index claiming "recently active" about a month-old list, an unlabeled snapshot of data that lives live elsewhere.
- **Bloat** — too much piles in and the model loses the thread. Oversized always-loaded files, scratch inside the knowledge tree, one mega-store where segmented stores should be.
- **Confusion** — something the agent needs is missing, or something off-topic is present. Unmapped folders, data pulled but never ingested, off-domain notes in the knowledge layer.
- **Clash** — two pieces of context contradict, usually old versus new. Duplicate folders, the same fact living in two stores at two ages, rules added piecewise with no declared winner.

Anchor: poisoning is false, bloat is too much, confusion is wrong-or-missing, clash is contradictory. **Tag every finding in the report with the failure mode it feeds.** A finding that feeds none of the four is probably cosmetic; say so and rank it last.

The second lens is *when context loads*:

- **Expertise context** — stable knowledge needed on every call: the operating manual, standing rules, memory index, hot cache. Preloaded, so every word is paid for every session.
- **Situational context** — live, specific, only matters in the moment: project files, wiki pages, feeds. Fetched just in time through routing.

The audit checks that facts sit on the correct side (Check 6). A live number baked into a preloaded file WILL go stale (poisoning) while taxing every session (bloat). A standing rule buried in one project folder is invisible when it's needed (confusion).

## Step 0 — Prior report and recent evidence

1. Look for earlier reports in `audits/os-audit-*.md`. If one exists, read the most recent. The final report must include a "Since last audit" section: what got fixed, what got worse, what's new.
2. If any audit of this project ran within the last week (this skill, or another audit with saved findings), reuse its still-valid evidence and re-verify only what could have changed. Don't re-sweep the whole project to rediscover week-old findings.

## Execution

For a large project (100+ folders), fan out one Explore subagent per check below, giving each the check's instructions verbatim plus the project root, then merge their reports. For a small project, run the checks yourself in order.

**If there is no operating manual and no indexes at all:** that is itself the number-one finding. Report Routing and Index checks as RED with "no routing layer exists: your agent is navigating by guesswork," recommend creating a CLAUDE.md router first, and continue with checks 3-5 (they don't need a manual).

### Check 1 — Routing integrity ("does everything it points to exist?")

1. Read the operating manual (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, AGENTS.md, or equivalent). Extract every path, folder, and file it references, including routing tables. Verify each exists on disk. A routing rule that points at a missing path means the agent confidently walks into a wall.
2. Reverse direction: list top-level directories and compare against the manual. Flag real, active directories the routing map doesn't mention. Unmapped = invisible to a fresh session.
3. Misroutes count too: a rule that points at a place that exists but is NOT where the current data actually lives is worse than a dead path, because nothing errors.
4. Spot-check hardcoded paths inside `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.claude/agents/*.md`. Skills fail silently on dead paths.
5. If a persistent memory system exists (a MEMORY.md index or memory folder): verify each index entry resolves to a file, and flag memory files missing from the index.

### Check 2 — Index truth ("do the indexes match the disk?")

1. Find every index file: `_index*.md`, `INDEX.md`, catalog sections in READMEs, hot-cache/summary files. For each, diff its entries against the actual directory contents, both directions: rows with no folder (phantoms) and folders with no row (orphans).
2. Check any counts the index claims ("55 folders", "page_count: 50") against reality.
3. Check any freshness claims ("Recently Active", "updated weekly", `updated:` frontmatter) against real file dates. An index that says "last 14 days" but whose newest entry is a month old is actively lying to the agent.

### Check 3 — Freshness ("are the data feeds current?")

1. Identify every recurring data source: transcript pulls, meeting ingests, API exports, wikis, analytics dumps, anything with dated files or a fetch/refresh script. For each, find the newest dated artifact and compare against the feed's natural cadence (weekly meetings should have last week's file; daily pulls, yesterday's).
2. Classify each feed:
   - **FRESH** — within one cycle.
   - **DRIFTING** — one cycle behind.
   - **FROZEN** — more than one cycle behind, and the OS still implies it's current. Estimate what's missing ("3 weekly syncs and one major event absent").
   - **RETIRED?** — more than ~2 months dead. Don't assume it's broken; ask the user whether they stopped on purpose. If retired, the fix is updating the OS so it stops implying the feed is current, not reviving it.
   - **ON-DEMAND** — feeds with no natural cadence (per-video, per-request). Not stale by definition; note the last run and move on.
3. **Check both layers: pulled vs ingested.** Data can be fresh in the raw layer (files pulled to disk) and frozen in the knowledge layer (never summarized/indexed where the agent actually looks). Report each feed's raw date AND its ingested date when the project has that split. The gap between them is un-queryable knowledge.
4. Check hot-cache / summary files (the small files loaded every session): are their key numbers and active threads dated within their claimed refresh cycle?
5. **Memory staleness:** scan memory notes for time-dimensioned facts: counters ("107 left"), snapshots ("425K members"), statuses ("still open", "in progress"), and future-tense events that are now past. Flag the provably stale ones.
6. Report the single date that matters most: "your AIOS's knowledge effectively ends on YYYY-MM-DD," using the ingested layer, not the raw layer.

### Check 4 — Bloat, duplication, and organization ("does anything live twice, or in the wrong place, or for no reason?")

1. Duplicate hunts: same content or purpose in two places (a folder in both active and archive locations; two folders whose names describe the same thing, e.g. `thing-v2` vs `Thing results v2`). Flag each pair with a recommendation for which is canonical.
2. Stale one-offs: folders containing a single old file, finished point-in-time work (past-quarter planning, old event assets), demos untouched for 60+ days. Archive candidates, not delete candidates.
3. Scratch contamination: temp files, API response dumps, `_tmp_*`, `__pycache__`, empty stub files or folders sitting inside the knowledge tree where a blind search will treat them as knowledge.
4. Always-loaded weight: word-count the files loaded every session (operating manual, memory index, hot cache). Flag growth; every extra line here taxes every future session.
5. Rule violations: if the manual states placement rules ("all X goes in one folder per Y"), find violators.
6. **Root hygiene.** The project root should read like a table of contents: folders, the operating manual, a README, and almost nothing else. Every loose file at root is a finding. Classify each by role and recommend a home that ALREADY EXISTS in the project:
   - temp/scratch output (API response dumps, one-session JSON, stray exports) → the archive or tmp folder
   - reusable assets (logos, face cutouts, brand images) → the assets/brand folder
   - media sources (recordings, renders) → their project's folder, or the archive if the project shipped
   - documents → the folder of the subject they belong to
   Only propose creating a new folder when nothing existing fits. Before recommending any move, grep for references to the file (scripts, skills, docs): a file referenced by a live code path must be flagged as move-with-caution, with the referencing paths listed.
7. **Intuitiveness gut check.** Pick 3 recent artifacts the user would plausibly ask for and walk the folder tree to them like a human in a file explorer: can each be found by clicking down obviously-named folders, no search? Flag any folder whose purpose isn't guessable from its name, and any artifact that took a wrong turn to find. If a human can't follow the trail, the agent is navigating on luck.

### Check 5 — Hygiene and silent failures ("what's broken or exposed without anyone noticing?")

1. Secrets and personal data:
   - **If the project is a git repo:** check that `.env` and any OAuth/credential files are gitignored AND untracked (`git check-ignore`, `git ls-files`). Grep tracked files for exported personal data (inbox dumps, private-call transcripts) that shouldn't be in history.
   - **If it is not a git repo:** scan directly for credential-looking files and exported personal data sitting in the knowledge tree, flag them, and note as a finding that the project has no version control (no history, no rollback, and no ignore layer for the day it becomes a repo).
2. Dead capabilities: skill folders whose file isn't exactly `SKILL.md`, missing or empty frontmatter descriptions, agents referencing models or paths that don't exist. These never load and never error.
3. Orphans: agent-memory folders with no matching agent, empty directories, 0-byte files.
4. Cadence reality check: do any hooks or scheduled jobs actually exist, or is every "recurring" process manual? Manual-only cadence is the root cause of most Check-3 freezes; say so explicitly if found.

### Check 6 — Context placement ("is everything on the right side of the expertise/situational line?")

1. Inventory the expertise layer: every file loaded into every session (operating manual, rules files, memory index, hot cache, skill descriptions). For each, scan for **situational facts baked in**: live counters, member/subscriber numbers, in-progress statuses, future-tense events, anything with a shelf life. Each one is a double finding: guaranteed future poisoning (it will go stale in a file the agent always trusts) and per-session bloat (paid for on every call). The fix is a pointer ("current numbers live in X"), not a fresher copy.
2. Reverse direction: **expertise buried in situational stores**. Standing rules, conventions, or preferences stated only inside one project folder, one old memory note, or one chat export, where no fresh session will find them. Confusion risk; the fix is promoting the rule to the manual/rules layer.
3. Precedence rule: when two stores disagree on a fact, does the manual say which one wins? If no precedence rule exists anywhere, every duplicated fact is a live clash waiting to fire. Recommend one line: "X is the source of truth for Y; everything else points at it."
4. Duplicated facts across stores: spot-check 3-5 important facts (key numbers, key statuses). Do they live in exactly one place plus pointers, or in multiple places at multiple ages? Multiple ages = clash; report the oldest copy as the poisoning risk.

## Output — the report

Print in chat, then save to `audits/os-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `audits/` if needed; this is the skill's only write).

## Failure-mode exposure

| Mode | Exposure | Driven by |
|---|---|---|

| Bloat (too much)             | HIGH/MED/LOW | ... |
| Confusion (wrong or missing) | HIGH/MED/LOW | ... |
| Clash (contradictory)        | HIGH/MED/LOW | ... |

## Since last audit
{only if a prior report exists: fixed / worse / new. Omit on first run.}

## What would make your agent wrong-answer you today
{2-4 bullets: the findings that cause "it says it isn't there but it is" or confidently stale answers}

## Findings by check
{concise bullets per check; every finding names a concrete path AND ends with its
failure-mode tag: [poisoning] [bloat] [confusion] [clash]. Include the feed
freshness table: feed | raw date | ingested date | cadence | verdict | what's missing.}

## Questions for you
{feeds classified RETIRED? — "did you stop this on purpose?" — and anything else only the owner can answer}

## Fix list (batched, await approval)
- Batch A — security + dead capabilities (do first)
- Batch B — routing + index reconciliation + re-homing misplaced files (root cleanup)
- Batch C — data catch-up (re-run frozen pipelines, refresh stale memory, retire dead feeds officially)
- Batch D — durability (hooks/crons/rituals so it can't silently freeze again)
```

Verdict rules: RED = at least one finding that would cause wrong answers today (frozen pipeline, lying index, dead or misrouted routing rule, tracked secret, stale fact in an always-loaded file). YELLOW = drift that will get there (unindexed folders, duplicates, bloat, missing precedence rule). GREEN = checked and clean. Feeds the user confirms as retired don't count toward RED once the OS stops implying they're current. Be honest; a first run on a real, used AIOS should rarely be all green.

Exposure rules: a mode is HIGH when a RED finding feeds it, MED when only YELLOW findings feed it, LOW when nothing does. The exposure table is the audit's teaching moment: it tells the user not just what's broken but *how it will bite*.

## Notes

- Do not fix anything during the audit, even trivial things. Report first; the fix list is the deliverable.
- Prefer dated filenames and content dates for freshness. File mtimes are the weakest signal: bulk git operations (clone, checkout, big commits) AND cloud-sync tools (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) can touch every file at once. If many mtimes cluster on one timestamp, verify with content or git log before calling anything "active."
- A stale local snapshot of data whose live source of truth is an external tool (a task manager, a CRM) is a labeling problem, not a freshness problem. The fix is marking it "snapshot — live data lives in X," not endless re-syncing.
- Suggest re-running quarterly, or after any big reorganization. The "Since last audit" section is the payoff for saving dated reports.
- If the project also has the AIS-OS kit's `/audit` skill, that's the companion: `/audit` scores whether the AIOS is built right (Four Cs, structural); `/os-audit` checks whether it's still true. Run both for the full picture. If `/audit` isn't installed, skip the reference; this skill stands alone.
